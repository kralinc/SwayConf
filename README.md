## SwayConf
### Graphical Configuration Utility for SwayWM
### Very in development, not usable yet

Current roadmap in order
* Wallpapers
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Display
* Whatever else

One of the main goals of SwayConf is to make it very clear that it is simply a frontend for a text file. 
Every graphical component will be able to be switched to "text mode" where you can see and modify what is actually going to be written to your sway config.
Yeah
